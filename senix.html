  <h1 class="mid">Square Enix</h1>
  <p>Square Enix Holdings Co., Ltd.[a] is a Japanese video game holding company and entertainment conglomerate, best known for its Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Seiken Densetsu (Mana), Star Ocean, and Kingdom Hearts role-playing video game franchises, among numerous others. In 2009, Square Enix Holdings acquired British game publisher Eidos Interactive, which was absorbed into Square Enix Europe to publish titles such as Tomb Raider, Deus Ex and Just Cause. In 2005, Square Enix acquired arcade gaming corporation Taito, known for games such as Space Invaders, Bubble Bobble, and Darius. Outside of video game publishing and development, Square Enix is also in the business of merchandise, arcade/amusement facilities, and manga publication under its Gangan Comics brand.</p>

  <p>Several of its games franchises have sold over 10 million copies worldwide, with the Final Fantasy franchise selling 144 million, the Dragon Quest franchise selling 78 million and the Kingdom Hearts franchise selling 30 million.[3] The Square Enix is headquartered in the Shinjuku Eastside Square Building in Shinjuku, Tokyo and has over 5000 employees worldwide through its base operations and subsidiaries.</p>
  
  <p>The original Square Enix Co., Ltd. was formed in April 2003 due to a merger between Square and Enix, with the latter as the surviving company. Each share of Square's common stock was exchanged for 0.85 shares of Enix's common stock. At the time, 80% of Square Enix staff were made up of former Square employees. As part of the merger, former Square president Yoichi Wada was appointed the president of the new corporation, while former Enix president Keiji Honda was named vice president. Yasuhiro Fukushima, the largest shareholder of the combined corporation and founder of Enix, became chairman.</p>
  
  <p>In October 2008, Square Enix conducted a company split between its corporate business and video game operations. Square Enix reorganized itself as Square Enix Holdings Co., Ltd., a holding company, while its internally domestic video game operations were formed as a new subsidiary called Square Enix Co., Ltd.</p>
